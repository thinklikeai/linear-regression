# Linear Regression from Scratch in Python

## **Introduction**

This repository hosts a Python project that implements **Linear Regression from scratch**, aiming to provide an in-depth understanding of the algorithm's underlying mechanics. The project seeks to demystify the complexity associated with machine learning algorithms by breaking down the essential components of Linear Regression, one of the simplest yet powerful algorithms in the machine learning toolbox.

## **Project Overview**

### **Data Visualization**

The project starts with a scatter plot visualization of the dataset, providing an initial assessment of the relationship between the variables—specifically, between the hours a student has studied and their corresponding exam score. This graphical representation serves as a foundation for understanding the linear relationship that the model aims to capture.

### **Custom Loss Function**

A key feature of this project is the implementation of a **custom loss function**. This loss function measures the quality of the model by calculating the error between the predicted exam scores and the actual scores in the dataset. By minimizing this error, the model becomes better at making predictions.

### **Gradient Descent Algorithm**

Another significant component is the **custom-built Gradient Descent algorithm**. This optimization algorithm fine-tunes the model parameters in order to minimize the loss function. It iteratively adjusts the model's parameters—slope and y-intercept of the linear equation—towards the values that yield the minimum error.

### **Predictive Modeling**

Upon optimizing the parameters, the model is ready to make predictions. The project uses the final values of the model parameters to estimate exam scores based on the number of hours studied. A line plot is then generated to visualize these predictions alongside the original data points, providing a comprehensive view of the model's performance.

## **Technologies Used**

- The project is entirely written in **Python**, capitalizing on its flexibility and ease of use for numerical computations.
- For data manipulation and handling, the **Pandas** library is used. It offers data structures for efficiently storing large arrays and convenient data manipulation functions.
- Data visualization is performed using **Matplotlib**, offering a straightforward way to plot graphs for visual data analysis.

## **Conclusion**

This project serves both educational and practical purposes. It is designed for those who want to understand the core mechanics of Linear Regression without relying on high-level machine learning libraries. By dissecting the algorithm into its basic elements, this project offers a hands-on approach to understanding machine learning algorithms from the ground up.
